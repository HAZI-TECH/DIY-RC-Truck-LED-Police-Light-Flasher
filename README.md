DIY RC Truck LED Police Light Flasher With Push Button Pattern Control
==============

Introduction
----
This is an upgraded version of my simple RC Truck LED VIP Light / Police Light Flasher made with an ATtiny85 microcontroller. You can even use an Arduino Nano or UNO for this. It has 9 patterns which you can select with the push button. The chosen pattern is saved in the memory so that it runs even after the power restarts. And 8 LEDs were used In this video. But based on your requirement, you can use more / less LEDs.
